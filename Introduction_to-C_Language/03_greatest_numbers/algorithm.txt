Step1: Start
Step2: Read n (must be â‰¥3, else show error.)
Step3: Allocate arr of size n
Step4: Read n numbers into n
Step5: Short arr in ascending order:
  - For i from 0 to n-2
    - For j from 0 to n-2-i
      - if arr[j]>arr[j+1], swap them
Step6: Display:
  - Greatest = arr[n-1]
  - Third greatest = arr[n-3]
Step7: Free memory
Step8: End
